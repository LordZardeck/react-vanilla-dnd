# DropZone

The basics of drag and drop within React can actually be handled fairly easily with the native drag and drop API.
The primary concept to understand is the DataTransfer object. Utilizing this well allows us to have a performant
and abstract way of decoupling the drag source and drop destination. In addition, by utilizing the
[DataTransfer.setDragImage()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/setDragImage) method,
we can set a custom dragged image that follows the cursor without needing to track mouse movements or offsets.

## DataTransfer Data Types

Utilizing the DataTransfer's concept of data types in MIME format, we can quite easily have a decoupled system
where the drag source and drop destination don't need to know about each other. This can be demonstrated by the
concept of allowing a user to drag an image onto your app. Some drop zones might support an image file, but will upload
the image on drop, while others might display the image with cropping controls. The dropzones have no connection with
the original drag location, which could even be from outside the application. All the dropzones need to do is inform
the DragEvent they support the data type currently being dropped.

Taking this concept further, we can create our own data types to indicate that a dragged item is of a specific type,
and any drop zones that support that type can accept the drop. In order to accomplish this in a consistent and
standards compliant way, we utilize the `vnd` or `prs` [MIME subtype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type#Subtypes),
with the `+json` suffix. This allows us to define our own data types in a way that is unlikely to conflict with other
data types, and is easily recognizable as a custom data type.

For example, we might define a TODO item data type as `application/prs.my-app.todo+json`, which would have the following
schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "type": "string"
}
```

And now, in our TODO app, when the user starts dragging a Todo item, we can set the data of the drag event like so:

```typescript
import {DragEvent} from "react";

function handleDragStart(event: DragEvent) {
  event.dataTransfer.setData('application/prs.my-app.todo+json', JSON.stringify('8c511d7c-1cc7-4da9-9baa-189c5037490b'));
}
```

## Example
<Canvas of={DropzoneStories.SimpleCopy} sourceState='none'/>

<Subtitle>Draggable Component</Subtitle>
<Source
    language='tsx'
    format={false}
    code={DraggableSource}
/>

<Subtitle>DropZone Component</Subtitle>
<Source
    language='tsx'
    format={false}
    code={DropZoneSource}
/>
